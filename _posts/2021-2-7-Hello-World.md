For those among us who love the abstract subjects like economics or psychology a bit too much, we sometimes get a need to build something concrete and not just get trapped in the prison of our wandering mind, thinking endlessly about airy matters, e.g., why didn't Thatcher sleep a bit more?

On that effect, I've tried to build a little website for myself, a little outlet to get in touch with the very physical world of the Internet.
