title: On the joy of building practical stuff
---

For those among us who love abstract subjects like economics or psychology a little too much, we often feel a need to build something concrete and not just walking around giving ammunition to STEM bros who accuse us of being trapped in the prison of our mind, thinking endlessly about airy matters. Instead of thinking 'What if Thatcher got more sleep?', we should build websites with dark theme so it's easier on the eyes of folks lying in bed at night.

On that effect, this website is an effort to build a little something for myself, an outlet to get in touch with the very physical world of the Internet (compare to most of the social sciences).
