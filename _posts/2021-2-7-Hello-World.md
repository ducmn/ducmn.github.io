For those among us who love abstract subjects like economics or psychology a little too much, guilt might drive us to feel a need to build something concrete and not just give ammunition to technology brothers who accuse us of being too trapped inside our own mind. Vietnamese education system forces kids to specialise too early, and it produces either STEM geniuses who think Trump is their saviour, or idiots like me who regret not studying more Computer Science.

On that note, this website is my personal effort to build a little something for myself.
