For those among us who love abstract subjects like economics or psychology a little too much, we often feel a need to build something concrete and not just walking around giving ammunition to technology brothers who accuse us of being trapped inside our own mind, thinking endlessly about airy matters. Vietnamese education system forces kids to specialise too early, and it produces either STEM geniuses who think Donald Trump is their saviour, or idiots like me who regret not studying more Computer Science.

On that note, this website is my personal effort to build a little something for myself, an outlet to horn my technical skills and write what I want.
