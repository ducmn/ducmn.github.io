title: The Frontier of Politics
---

The frontier of politics is different in every country, but the starkest difference lies between rich ones and poor ones. Considering most people in the world live in "poor" countries, we have to keep in mind that they don't really give a damn about what people in rich countries care about, e.g., Twitter bans, de-platforming, etc. And only the elite care about the aforementioned topics anyway.

What do they care about? Increasing fuel/bread prices because their corrupt government ran out of money to subsidise these products (these products were subsidised in the first place because of "bread & circus" reasons). They worry about corruption, mainly. They worry about how to maintain a good standard of living, and hence their dignity. Nobody gives a damn about Netflix bans there.
