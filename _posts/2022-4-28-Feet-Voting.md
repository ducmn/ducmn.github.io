So the usual claim is that "if you don't like your country, you should leave". As if that's so easy to do.

I'd like to see a Vietnamese production of James Bond, the globe-trotting super spy. We open on James in a visa office, trying to produce evidence that he has not left Vietnam in the last 3 months. They ask who his parents are, where he lives, the balance of his bank account. Cut to 2 months later, when the bad guys have won and James finally got his visa sent to him (albeit to the wrong address).
