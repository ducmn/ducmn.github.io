title: As if we were never apart

"As if we were never apart" is the clunky name of an extremely sentimental Vietnamese TV show. I believe this is a show that can only be made in post-war countries. Korea has a similar show. The entire premise of this show is to find the missing friend/relative of show poor soul on TV. It makes for tear-jerking moments.

It's excruciating to watch, in a good way. Almost all of the stories are due to the Vietnam War, though that fact just floats in the background. We are shown mainly how life has been for the relatives since they were pulled apart. Some moved to a different country. This show is humanism at its finest. Truly compelling television.
