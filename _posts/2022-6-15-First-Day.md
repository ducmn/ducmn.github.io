So I enter a relatively new phase of my life. A new job. Giddiness is the predominant emotion, I suppose that's how I'm built. The anxiety of the Skilled Worker visa, where your entire identity hinges on the fact that you have a job in a First World country; failure means deportation.

To be honest, I feel pretty excited. Hope this new firm can deal with my excitement.
