So I enter a relatively new phase of my life. A new job. Nervousness is the predominant emotion, I suppose that's how I'm built. The anxiety of the Skilled Worker visa, where your entire identity hinges on the fact that you have a job in a First World country. To be honest, I'm pretty excited too. Hope this new firm can deal with my excitement.
