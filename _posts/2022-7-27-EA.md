- Marry a smart 3rd world citizen if you're a 1st world citizen: Get a prenup, organise a sham marriage, get the 3rd worlder their citizenship, divorce them amicably (without personal losses to yourself), rinse and repeat. You would change multiple lives, and multiply the income of many people.
- Income-sharing scholarship for smart 3rd world citizens: Get like the top chemistry major in Indochina who is also fluent in English, fund their place at some cheap US college. They should be smart enough to get into Google/Cornell after their Bachelor's degree, and you'd recoup your investment from their income.
