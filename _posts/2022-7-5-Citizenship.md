I recently complained to an acquaintance about the fact that I have Vietnamese citizenship. I expected sympathy, but this idiot was completely oblivious about the struggle of third world people. In his mind, he imagine the Far East as some kind of idyllic place where all is well. Below are my complaints, his counter-arguments, and my responses to them:

- You can’t enter any country: He said "You can. You're in UK." The ignorance in this response. If traveling abroad is so easy, there would be no one left in Vietnam.
- No freedom of speech: "It always falls in deaf ears unless you're someone important." I know, but at least you don’t go to prison in first world countries.
- Can’t vote: "This too is overrated I feel. Look at Brexit. British people voted & it turned out for the worse in my opinion. Still negotiations of legislation haven't been finalised." Authoritarianism only works without corruption. The human heart is greedy and fickle, hence we need checks and balance.
- At the end of the day, no one choose to migrate to Vietnam (or even China); most people freely choose Western countries: "People may want to retire there as they'll get more for their money & a traditional woman in Asia compared to one that lives in the Western society." Now I know what kind of person I'm talking to. I vastly revised down my prior about this guy. But sadly, this is the mentality that quite a lot of men have.

So it's really hard to have a civilised conversation about any topic if your interlocutor isn't very smart. It's certainly not PC to say it, but this realisation makes me think that it'd be very hard to rebuild trust in society and in democracies. Problems are getting harder to solve, and a lot of people in society haven't even thought deep enough to even begin to engage with these issues. How do you resolve Brexit when plenty of men still think women should stay at home? How do you push culture forward? Are technological advances, the kind that doesn't depend on culture, our only hope for a better future? Does an immoral populace deserve an immoral prime minister?
