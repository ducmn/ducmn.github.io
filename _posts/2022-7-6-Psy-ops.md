I think the video game industry has been running a massive psy-op for decades. How many times have you seen a writing on the internet that goes something like "time you enjoy isn't time wasted"? David Foster Wallace would have an absolute field day with this industry if he is still alive today.

And this psy-op seems to disproportionately affect young men. It offers them an easy escape, being heroes in worlds not our own. I think there would be outcries tomorrow if there's a digital product that sucks in the attention of women, rendering them in a state of perpetual bliss, unwilling to work and to live life as normal. But since it's young men, we can afford to throw them to the wolves.
