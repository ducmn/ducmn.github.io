I heard that my old sixth-form is now closed due to lack of international students from the Chinese lockdown, Brexit, and Covid.

I have mixed feelings about the place. The dormitory system was horrible for me; it was basically  prison. Some teachers changed my life, like Dr. Elizabeth Cheng (statistics) and Mr. Russ Howells (critical-thinking). The rest of the names faded into a blur.
