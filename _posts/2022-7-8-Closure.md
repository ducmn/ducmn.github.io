I heard that my old sixth-form has been closed due to lack of international students from a range factors including the Chinese lockdown, Brexit, and COVID.

I have mixed feelings about the place. The dormitory system was horrible for me; sixth form seemed like prison at the time (Paul Graham [had plenty to say](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html) on this subject). Some teachers changed my life, like Dr. Elizabeth Cheng (statistics) and Mr. Russ Howells (critical-thinking/philosophy). The rest of the names faded into a blur.
