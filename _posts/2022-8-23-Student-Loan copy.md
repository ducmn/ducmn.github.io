It's wild that Vietnam doesn't have a student loan system. For a country that prizes credentials so much, it's strange that the government give out such meager amount as loan to students. Banks make the loan application process insanely complicated; it's nearly unheard of that anyone has ever borrow from a bank to fund their studies. Many people just drop out and work mediocre jobs instead of finishing their study.
