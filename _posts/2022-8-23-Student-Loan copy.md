It's wild that Vietnam doesn't have a student loan system. For a country that prizes credentials so much, it's strange that the government give out such meager amount as loan to students. Banks make the loan application process insanely complicated; it's nearly unheard of that anyone has ever borrow from a bank to fund their studies. Many people just drop out and work mediocre jobs instead of finishing their study.

To get into university, students must participate in an exam "block":
Block A: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry
Block A1: Mathematics, Physics, English language
The best in Block As are the god-tier geniuses, the best minds of their generation.

Block B: Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology
Block C: Literature, History, Geography
Block D1: Literature, Mathematics, English language
Block D2: Literature, Mathematics, Russian language
Block D3: Literature, Mathematics, French language
Block D4: Literature, Mathematics, Chinese language
Block D5: Literature, Mathematics, German language
Block D6: Literature, Mathematics, Japanese language
