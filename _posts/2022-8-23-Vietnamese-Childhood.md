title: Vietnamese Childhood

If you grow up in Vietnam, chances are that your parents will care a lot about your education and what you obtain at school. Not just any subject. Maths and English. Maths and English are the way out, out of this country. I was good at other things too, but poets aren't high on any country's list of occupational shortages.

The methods Vietnamese parents use to motivate their kids are certainly questionable by Western standards. A friend of mine got scolded whenever he got 9 out of 10 on a test. He's at Cornell now.

Every Vietnamese parents believe in the what's euphemistically termed "the neighbour's child", that magical kid who does everything right. Somehow that try-hard kid exists in every square-kilometre of the country, so there's always a real-life example of them. Itâ€™s an absolutely horrible feeling being compared to them, whoever this kid is (I was sometimes this kid).

Not just parents, it's a whole-society kind of thing when it comes to gang-pressing children to study. As a form of psychological warfare, Vietnamese teachers would shout out the grades of all students after a test, in front of the whole class, either from highest to lowest or vice versa (which one is worse?). I believe this served no purpose but to:
1. Remind the under-performers (me, sometimes) of how stupid they are, and how they better catch up
2. Solidify the ego of the smartest kids

There's a test like every other week, to add to the horror.

I do hate the horrible pressure that I experienced, and no kid should have to go through that. But then again, I've seen kids whose lives have no pressure at all, and they grow up to lead aimless lives in their hometown. I suppose if you grow up in a fucked environment, the only way out is to make your childhood temporarily (for about 11 years) even more fucked by putting your head to the grindstone. Only then could you escape your circumstances, and the most popular escape route is through a foreign education.

Me and my friends are products of our culture. There's little possibility of cultural change in Vietnam, hence little chance of change in the typical childhood of a Vietnamese kid.
