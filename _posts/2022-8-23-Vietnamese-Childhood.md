If you grow up in Vietnam, chances are that your parents will care a lot about your education and what you obtain at school. Not just any subject, no. Maths and English. Maths and English are the way out, out of this godforsaken country. I was good at other things too, but poets weren’t high on any country's list of occupational shortages.

The methods Vietnamese parents use to motivate their kids are questionable. I remember how my Mom would be on the phone with a family friend whose son is in my class. This guy was my rival, and he would always snitch to his mom whenever I had bad grades, and that was how my mom usually found out. That little snitch was the bane of my existence; he's at Cornell now.

I suppose Mom's own lack of education contributed to her behaviour. She was deprived of a chance to go to university when she was younger (due to The War). She eventually went back to university when she was nearly 40. Ironically, she is very suspicious of anyone who doesn’t go to college.

Praises were seldom. I'm pretty sure that the last time that happened was when I was the only person in class to achieve the perfect score on a test, which was in 5th grade. My parents standards are strangely high: they were terrified that I wasn’t in the top 10 for anything in secondary school (in a class of >60).

Every Vietnamese parents believe in the what's euphemistically termed "the neighbour's child", that magical kid who does everything right. Somehow that try-hard asshole exist in every square-kilometre of the country, so there's always a real-life example of her. It’s an absolutely horrible feeling being compared to her, whoever this kid is (I'm sometimes this kid).

Not just parents, it's a whole-society kind of thing when it comes to gang-pressing children to study. As a form of psychological warfare, Vietnamese teachers would shout out the grades of all students after a test, in front of the whole class, either from highest to lowest or vice versa (which is worse?). I believe this served no purpose but to:

1. Remind the under-performers (me, sometimes) of how stupid they are, and how they better catch up
2. Solidify the ego of the smartest kids

There's a test like every other week to add to the horror.

I do hate the horrible pressure that I experienced, and no kid should have to go through that. But then again, I've seen kids whose lives have no pressure at all, and they grow up to lead aimless lives in the Vietnamese town they grew up in. I suppose if you grow up in a fucked environment, the only way un-fuck your future is to make your childhood temporarily (for about 11 years) even more fucked by putting your head to the grindstone. Only then could you escape your circumstances, and the most popular escape route is via a foreign education.

Me and my friends are products of our culture. There's little possibility of regime change in Vietnam, and no foreign aid, hence little chance of change in the typical childhood of a Vietnamese kid.
