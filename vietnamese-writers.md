title: Vietnamese Writers Recommendations
permalink: /vietnamese-writers/

Vietnamese literature is a minefield for any beginners as it's choked full of propaganda for obvious historical reasons. There is also no trustworthy book-recommendation system in Vietnam, unlike the overly muscular Book Review Ecosystem in the West. To save myself (and others) time sifting the wheat from the chaff, below are authors I find to be interesting and less propagandistic (those who are tend to produce more Straussian type of work):
- Nguyễn Minh Châu: Deceptively simple prose on the Vietnam War blended with esoteric references to Vietnamese culture; this guy was from Nghệ An (one of poorest province in VN) so he was a true writer of the people
- Bảo Ninh: His one-hit-wonder remains a touchstone in Vietnam War literature
- Phùng Quán: Very Straussian, so don't be fooled by his seemingly pro-Communist tone
- Trần Đăng Khoa: Clearly a clever guy who has been trying to escape people's perception of him as a child prodigy for decades
- Viet Thanh Nguyen: I this idealistic-second-generation-American-immigrant out of touch with what's happening in Vietnam, though he offers a nice outsider's view on things
- Hồ Xuân Hương: No one knows if she exists, but she's one of the funniest and cheekiest Vietnamese poet who has ever lived
