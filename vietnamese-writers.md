title: Vietnamese Writers Recommendations

Vietnamese literature is a minefield for folks interested in it. It's full of propaganda for obvious reasons. There is also no trustworthy book-recommendation system in Vietnam like the Book Review sections exist in the West. To save myself (and others) time sifting the wheat from the chaff, below are authors I find to be interesting and less propagandistic (those who are tend to produce more Straussian type of work):
- Nguyễn Minh Châu: Simple and emotional prose on the Vietnam War; from Nghe An (one of poorest province in VN) so he knew what he talked about
- Bảo Ninh: His one-hit-wonder remains a touchstone in war literature
- Phùng Quán: Very Straussian, so don't be fooled by his seemingly pro-Communist tone
- Trần Đăng Khoa: Straussian, and clearly a clever guy who has been trying to escape people's perception of him as a child prodigy for decades
- Viet Thanh Nguyen: Idealistic second-generation American immigrant, nice outsider's view on things
- Hồ Xuân Hương: No one knows if she exists, but she's one of the funniest and cheekiest Vietnamese poet who has ever lived
